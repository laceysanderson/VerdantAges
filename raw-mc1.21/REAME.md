This variant of the VerdantAges modpack focuses entirely on functionality and does not include any performance focused mods.

Additionally, it is focused on the Minecraft 1.21.x versions.

**Note: This is not an upgrade of Ages but rather a rebuild using the mods that most inspired me in Aged. Most notably, I will not be focusing on the Nether or the End.**
