<p align="center" style="font-style:italic">A challenging medieval-inspired modpack focused on exploration of the natural world.</p>

---

This modpack is highly inspired by the [Aged Modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/aged)! It strives to pay hommage to the original Aged modpack while also updating it to newer versions of Minecraft. While Aged focuses on the progression of the game all the way through "the End", this modpack is focused completely in the overworld. Additionally, I am very much a "builder" when it comes to Minecraft so I will be adding some packs focused on creating a consistent building palette that captures the nature-inspired, natural material charm that Aged already has.

## Status

This modpack is just being developed and still very much under construction. I do not recommend using it at this time.
